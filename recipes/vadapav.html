    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
    The most popular street food from Mumbai, so much so that Mumbai is almost synonymous to Vada Pav.
    It is basically Batata Vada sandwiched between slices of a Pav along with a generous amount of sweet and spicy chutneys.
    It might seem like a lot of hard work but its actually pretty quick and easy to make at home.
